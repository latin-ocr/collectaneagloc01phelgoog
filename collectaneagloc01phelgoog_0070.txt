While Angels with regret look down

To see you spurn 0 heavenly crown 1
Th' Etemal God calls from above,

And Jesns pleads his hleeding love ;
Awaken'd conscience gives you pain,
And shall they join their plens in vain 1
Glocester, Printed by John Pytt. MDCCLXXV.

A second and last address to the Ladies 01 Glo-
cester, by a Lady in the College.

Life is the time to serve the Lord,

The time t’insure the great reward,

And while the lamp holds out 10 burn,

The vilest sinner may return.

Life is the hour that God has given

To ’scape from hell, and fly to heaven—

The day of grace, and mortals may

Securo the blessings ο1 the day.-

Then what my thoughts assign to do,

My hands with all your might pursue,

· Since no device nor work is found,

Nor Faith, nor Hope, beneath the ground.

There are no acts 01 pardon pass’d

In the cold grave to which we haste ;

But darkness, death and long despair

Reign in eternal silence there. ,
